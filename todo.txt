-- Project proposal --

-- Code --

-- Data --
Share of high/low education types X hiigh/low income (DST)
Post tax wage X age profiles by education (DST)

-- Write paper --







------------- Plan:

------ Step 0:
- Utility function (CRRA)
- Return to education + cognitive type (Abbott paper)
- Retirement value (Keane)


------ Step 1
Solve working stage model:
- EGM 1 choice variable (exogenous labour supply), no uncertainty
- EGM with 2 choices, no uncertainty
- EGM with 2 choices, productivity shock to labor

Solve study stage model:
- just do it all at once


------ Step 2
- Glue models together 

------ Step 3
- Write simulation code
- Simulate data for estimation:
	- Choose parameters
	- Parameter of interest: correlation between parental types and cognitive types

----- Step 4
- Estimate parameter of interest:
	- Simulated method of moments
	- Moments: Share of children of high type parents with 1, 2, 3, 4, ... years of education.
	   Share of children of low type parents with 1,2,3... years of education.

------ Step 5:
- Write paper
