------------- Issues:

---- Problem with negative assets in last period
When we allow for negative assets in the final period, the solver
will sometimes not converge - seemingly at random. This gives us some
holes in the last period policy functions. If we risk ending up with 
negative assets in last period, we should fix this. Either:
- Use better solver, try different starting values etc.
- Interpolate over holes (lazy solution)

---- Retirement value
I'm having trouble with solving the model when there is incentive to
leave assets after the terminal period. For now, everything is just consumed.




------------- Plan:

------ Step 0:
- Utility function (CRRA) 
- Return to education + cognitive type (Abbott paper)


------ Step 1
Solve working stage model:
- EGM with 2 choices, productivity shock to labor
- budget constraint 

Solve study stage model:
- just do it all at once


------ Step 2
- Glue models together 

------ Step 3
- Write simulation code
- Simulate data for estimation:
	- Choose parameters
	- Parameter of interest: correlation between parental types and cognitive types

----- Step 4
- Estimate parameter of interest:
	- Simulated method of moments
	- Moments: Share of children of high type parents with 1, 2, 3, 4, ... years of education.
	   Share of children of low type parents with 1,2,3... years of education.

------ Step 5:
- Write paper
